Master's Degree Antenna & Wave Propagation Class Semester 3, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB)

**Tools & Equipment Used**
- CST Microwave Studio
- MATLAB

**Objective**

To implement and test an FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar signal generation and reception system using NI USRP and LabVIEW, and validate performance through real-time measurement.

**Description**

The sinuous antenna was chosen due to its self-complementary structure, which supports consistent performance across a wide frequency range. The antenna was designed on an FR4 substrate with a log-periodic configuration and tested through numerical simulations. Performance analysis focused on S11 parameters and radiation patterns to evaluate antenna characteristics.

**Outcome / Result**
- Achieved bandwidth of 5-10 GHz (simulation)
- Stable radiation pattern with broadside or end-fire directionkality
